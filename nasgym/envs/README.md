# Development notes

## FIXME: critic

## FIXME: minor

## TODO

- [ ] Think about the extra information we need to return in the step() function.
- [ ] Create a dataset handler that will take care of switching tasks (e.g. for meta-dataset).
- [ ] Establish some very basic defaults. This will be used for the reset operation as well.
- [ ] Load parameters from file (Maybe leave for later, cause the NAS environment defines that). Maybe export the actions from the nas-env repo as a file, and read them in this class.
- [ ] Implement all the logic for the step() function.
- [ ] Think about how to render the network, maybe a tensorflow plot or simply the vector as text. Maybe a plot with accuracy as well (but that would be more as to keep and historical).
